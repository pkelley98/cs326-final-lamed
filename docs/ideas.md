# Nutrition/Fitness Tracker (Name TBD)

# Team Lamed

## Team Overview

Patrick Kelley - github.com/pkelley98  
Jason Bolton - github.com/BoltyDawg  

## Idea
Our idea is to create an app that curates a specific diet/recipes based on the type of workout you aim to do. You will have the option to curate a recipe yourself or cycle through random ones until you find one you like. Also includes the ability for users to curate their own workout or choose one that is given. While similar to MyFitnessPal, this app differs because it curates a diet for the user based on how they workout.

## Important Components
Users will have the ability to either choose a diet based on recommendations or create their own.
Users will be given workouts based on their diets/goals.
Users will be ability to neatly view all of their data and modify it.
